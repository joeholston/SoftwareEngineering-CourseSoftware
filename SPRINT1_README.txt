NOTES REGARDING SPRINT 1- TEAM 3
--------------------------------------------------

Per Sprint 1 Release guidelines, we are able to omit a feature from Sprint 1 that was unable to be completed due to time restrictions and inability to allocate tasks for allotted time. Team 3 has not included the ability for a student's schedule to be saved/loaded locally. This will be a feature that has high priority and is included in Sprint 2.
